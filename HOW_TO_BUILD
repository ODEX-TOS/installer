* Since august 23 2019 we're only keeping needed/specific files to build calamares, so the build process is done by PKGBUILD. makepkg is responsible to merge our config files with latest calamares source
The current PKGBUILD can be accessed at https://github.com/endeavouros-team/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/Calamares_current

To have all functionalities be sure to install:

sudo pacman -S lsb-release cmake qt5-svg qt5-webengine yaml-cpp extra-cmake-modules boost networkmanager upower kcoreaddons kconfig ki18n kservice kwidgetsaddons kpmcore squashfs-tools rsync cryptsetup qt5-xmlpatterns doxygen dmidecode gptfdisk hwinfo kparts parted polkit-qt5 python qt5ct solid git qt5-tools pythonqt --needed

To use for endeavour, portergos or reborn just edit the line `branding: endeavouros` accordingly at settings.conf

Build requires the script `/usr/bin/cleaner_script.sh` (configurated at shellprocess module) to detect which distro is running and run some final fixes.
